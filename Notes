Implementation of cout is different for character and integer arrays.

Memory allocation of arrays occurs in stack memory.

New keyword can be used to allocate memory in heap for the array during runtime.

It is used for dynamic memory allocation for arrays.

Heap does not allow naming of allocated memory.
int* arr = new int[10];
char* ch = new char;
Named pointers will be created in the stack memory area.
